        This is the main scheduling algorithm that orchestrates task scheduling based on

        approach to schedule rigid tasks first, then fills gaps with flexible tasks.

            List of PlanItem objects representing the daily schedule. Scheduled items

        Algorithm (Greedy Scheduling):
            1. Validate preconditions (pet, owner, tasks exist)
            2. Separate tasks into rigid and flexible lists
            3. Sort rigid tasks by:
               - Dynamic priority (higher first, with urgency boost)
               - Duration (longer first, for better slot utilization)
            4. For each rigid task in priority order:
               a. Check dependencies - skip if not satisfied
               b. Calculate valid scheduling window (intersection of task window & owner availability)
               c. Find best available time slot using _find_best_time()
               d. If slot found: schedule task, mark slot occupied, add break time
               e. If no slot: mark task as unscheduled with reason
            5. Fill remaining gaps with flexible tasks using _fill_gaps()
            6. Sort scheduled items by time, append unscheduled items at end
            
        Considerations:
            - Pet species-specific recommendations (e.g., morning walks for dogs)
            - Task dependencies must be satisfied in order
            - Break time added between consecutive tasks
